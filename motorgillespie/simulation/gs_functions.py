def calc_force_1D(motor_team, motor_fixed, k_t, f_ex, t, i, end_run, x_motor0):
    """ Calculates the cargo position and motor forces in a one-dimensional system.

    This function first calculates the cargo position 'cargo_loc' based on the location
    ('MotorProtein.xm_abs') and stiffness ('MotorProtein.k_m') of all currently
    bound motors, and when applicable the external force ('f_ex') or trap stiffness ('k_t').
    After this, current motor forces are calculated for each individual motor based on their
    location, their motor stiffness and the cargo location.

    k_t : float

    f_ex: float

def draw_event(list_rates, sum_rates):
    """ Randomly selects an event to occur based on the given rates.

    This function determines which event will happen by drawing a random number from a uniform distribution and
    iterating through the list of rates 'list_rates'. Every iteration the conditional statement checks if the sum_prob
    is equal or smaller then the randomly chosen number. If this condition is true, the rate at index 'i' in 'list_rates'
    is divided by the sum of rates and added to 'sum_prob', and the index is raised by one. When the beforementioned condition
    is false, the event associated with the previous rate, for which the condition was true, is chosen for execution.

    This function is part of a Gillespie algorithm-based simulation, where 'list_rates' contains the rates
    of all possible events for all proteins. These rates are updated each iteration based on the
    current force acting on each motor and the bound or unbound state of each motor.

    Code based on: http://be150.caltech.edu/2019/handouts/12_stochastic_simulation_all_code.html

    Parameters
    ----------
    list_rates : list of floats
        List of rates of all possible events for all proteins.

        - Corresponding ID list: [motor1, motor1, motor2]

    sum_rates: float
